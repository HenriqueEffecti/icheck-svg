# iCheck-svg
Add SVG functionality to fronteed/iCheck for easy custom colors through LESS.


### General

This is a prototype to add SVG functionality to iCheck through LESS, although it's possible this could be achieved through any other "Language". What it does, is read an external SVG file and replaces a defined color with another one. Because firefox was giving the output problems due to not being encoded, this is also done in the process.
